[LINK](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13504)
##### QUOTES
* 

##### TAKEAWAYS
* they argue that the problem with using just deep learning is that they are heavily reliant on labelled data and limited background in the images
* they propose using combination of object detection, transfer learning and active learning to overcome these issues
* use of convolutional neural network to extract info from camera trap images
* difference form normal neural network is that only a few outputs from previous layer are transferred to the next neurons input and weights are trained to learn a useful pattern

##### QUOTES
* Computer vision-based methods are being used increasingly as tools to assist wild animal object recognition
* starting with the detection of animals in images and ending with identification decisions
* poor quality while others may show only parts of an animal due to self occlusion, or occlusion by other animals or vegetation
