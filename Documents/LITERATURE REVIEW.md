## WILD LIFE MONITORING
### IMPORTANCE OF
Why is monitoring important
What can we learn from animals?
Migration patterns, population densities, group interactions, feeding patterns

### METHODS
What are the methods of wildlife monitoring
Human observation, microphones, satellite images, camera traps, crowd source images
### CAMERA TRAPS
Talk about the popularity of camera traps
Issues with camera traps
* false triggers create huge amounts of data
* manually sifting through lots of data
* possible inaccuracies

## COMPUTER VISION IN WILDLIFE MONITORING

### WHAT IS CV
* broad description (algorithm that can interpret information from an image as a human could)
* CV can be used to extrapolate information from the camera trap photos which biologists desire if there are animals in a photo and in some cases where the animals are in the photos
* these techniques are known as object classification and detection
* object classification estimates what the probability is that an image is of each class
* object detection draws bounding boxes around objects in an image and estimates what the probability of the object being 
* 
* CNN's learn the features of from a set of training data 
* object classification
