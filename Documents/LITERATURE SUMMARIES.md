### DEEP ACTIVE LEARNING CAMERA TRAPS
[LINK](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13504)
##### TAKEAWAYS
* they argue that the problem with using just deep learning is that they are heavily reliant on labelled data and limited background in the images
* they propose using combination of object detection, transfer learning and active learning to overcome these issues
* use of convolutional neural network to extract info from camera trap images
* difference form normal neural network is that only a few outputs from previous layer are transferred to the next neurons input and weights are trained to learn a useful pattern

### OBJECT CLASSIFICATION AND VISUALISATION WITH EDGE AI FOR CUSTOMISED CAMERA TRAPS
[link]()
#### TAKEAWAYS
* give a good description of related work of edge-computing devices and transfer learning of small models
* process flow = train and validated on high end-computer (try different hyper parameters to get best) -> convert model to tensorflow lite
* they explored various transfer learning methods for training MobileNetV2

The literature review has led to a final [[PROPOSED SOLUTION]]
