The proposed solution is a remotely triggered camera trap placed above the Meerkats habitat which will be paired with a behavioural classification algorithm. The camera trap is to be a reliable and will be robust to the harsh conditions of the Kalahari. It shall also be capable of operating for hours on a single charge. The classification algorithm aims to identify all meerkats in the captured images and classify their behaviour into a broad class of actions. It will be run locally after data retrieval and will generate labelled images and time based dataset. This proposed solution is broken down into separate [[SUBSYSTEMS]].
